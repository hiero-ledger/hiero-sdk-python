# Hiero Python SDK – Community Call Notes

## Objectives
- Align on goals going forward

---

## Topics Discussed
1. **Version Support**
2. **Release Strategy, Committing, and Merging**
3. **README Organization**

---

## Issues Raised

### Versioning
- **Proposal**: Use `0.1.0` format following `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- **Outcome**: Agreed to adopt semantic versioning (0.1.0 is next release).

---

## Release Strategy

### Proposal
- Release every **2–4 weeks**, ideally on **Wednesday**.
- Merge changes into `main`.
- Deploy from a `/release` branch:
  - A short-lived branch created on **Tuesday** (the day before release) for final testing and release notes.
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG` to document changes.

### Outcome
- Typically aim for **every 2 weeks**, but if there’s not enough to release, it can go up to 4 weeks.

---

## Branching, Committing, and Merging

### Proposal
- **Branching**: Trunk-based development.
  - Example branch names: `feature/update_transaction`, `fix/generate_proto_error`.
  - `main` is always stable/production-ready.
- **Committing**: Use conventional commit prefixes such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`.
  - Meaningful commits are more important than perfect prefixes.
  - **Outcome**: 
    - PR titles should ideally include `feat:` or `fix:`.  
    - Individual commits can be more descriptive if that’s more natural, but clarity is key.
- **Merging**: 
  - **Squash & Merge** is preferred.  
  - Use **GPG key signing** (e.g., `git commit -s -S -m "added docstrings"`).
  - **Outcome**: General consensus on using squash, ensuring commits are signed, and writing good commit messages.

---

## README
- The current `README.md` is growing large.
- Suggestion that future examples could become a general doc referencing multiple SDKs, with a link to Hiero specifics.
- For now, we’ll add a specialized `README` in `/examples` to document syntax and transaction types.

**Outcome**:  
- Decision to move the current syntax/transaction-type content from `README.md` into a new `README` under `examples/`.

---

## Questions / Additional Notes

- Concerns were raised about GPG key setup on macOS requiring extra configuration not documented.  
  - **Action**: update `README.md` with a GPG setup walkthrough.
- Issues raised installing `uv` and running tests. All resolved, will be documented with steps.
- Differences across various SDKs were noted. Plans to start an **SDK meeting in two weeks** to explore more seamless cross-SDK development.
- Version `0.1.0` to be released 19th of February 2025.
- Deletion of unused / dummy versions.

---

## Summary of Outcomes

1. **Versioning**: Adopt `0.1.0` for next release; continue using semantic versioning.  
2. **Release Cadence**: Aim for every 2 weeks, or extend to 4 weeks if needed.  
3. **Branching & Committing**: Trunk-based with feature/fix branches, conventional commit messages (with some flexibility).  
4. **Merging**: Prefer squash and GPG signing.  
5. **README**: Move large sections (e.g., syntax/transaction details) to a separate doc in `/examples/`.  
6. **Action Items**:
   - Finalize the `0.1.0` release.
   - Document GPG setup steps for macOS users.
   - Provide notes on `uv` installation/test fix.
   - Schedule a cross-SDK alignment meeting in two weeks.
   - Remove dummy versions.
