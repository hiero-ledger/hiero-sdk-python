## üîÑ Improvements & Changes
We‚Äôve streamlined the SDK‚Äôs internal handling and improved code readability across key modules.

- `TransferTransaction` now uses `TokenTransfer` and `HbarTransfer` classes instead of dicts, offering a cleaner and more structured approach.
- Added **checksum validation** for `TokenId` for safer and more reliable operations.
- Refactored examples for better readability and consistency:
  - `token_cancel_airdrop.py`
  - `token_associate.py` (now includes association verification query ‚Äì #367)
  - `account_create.py` (enhanced modularity and readability ‚Äì #363)

---

## üêû Fixes
- Fixed a **type assignment issue** in `token_transfer_list.py`.
- Corrected internal method references (`__require_not_frozen()` ‚Üí `_require_not_frozen()`).
- Removed redundant `_is_frozen` method to reduce internal complexity.
