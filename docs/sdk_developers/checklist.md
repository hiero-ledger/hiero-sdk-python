## 1. Prior to Submission ✅

- [x] Changelog entry added under `## [Unreleased]`
- [x] Tests pass 
- [x] Only changes related to the issue are included
- [x] Code follows linting/formatting standards

## 2. Post-Submission Verification (Self-Check) 🔍

Once you have opened your Pull Request (PR), you must double-check the automated workflow results **BEFORE** requesting a formal review.

### How to Verify All Requirements on GitHub

Navigate to your PR page on GitHub and use the **Checks** and **Commits** tabs to verify the following:

| Requirement | GitHub Location | Status to Look For | Action if Failed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commit Signature** | **Commits Tab** | Must show **"Verified"** (Green badge) | See **[Signing Guide](signing.md)** for how to set up GPG and fix unverified commits. |
| **DCO Check** | **Checks Tab** | The "DCO" or "License" check must show a **Green Checkmark**. | See **[Signing Guide](signing.md)** to ensure your commits have the DCO sign-off (`-s`). |
| **Tests Pass (CI)** | **Checks Tab** (Workflows like 'Integration Tests') | All required tests must show a **Green Checkmark**. | View the logs for the failing check to debug the error locally. |
| **Changelog Formatting** | **Checks Tab** ('PR Formatting / Changelog Check') | Must show a **Green Checkmark**. | Correct the `CHANGELOG.md` entry and force push. |

### The Files Changed Tab (Maintainer's View)

The **Files Changed Tab** shows the exact **difference** between your branch and the `main` branch. This is the key document maintainers use for review.

**Your Goal:** Submitted PRs should have a diff that achieves the issue and meets all items in the pre-submit checklist.
