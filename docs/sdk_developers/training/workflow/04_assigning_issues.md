## Getting Assigned to an Issue

It is important to be assigned an issue before starting work on it or creating a pull request.

We recommend Good First Issues for developers new to the Python SDK. These are easier and better documented tasks.

To do that, 
1. Select a `Good First Issue` that interests you and is not yet assigned at [Python SDK Issues](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues)
2. Write a comment at the bottom of the issue page asking "I want to be assigned to this issue"
3. A maintainer will shortly assign you to the issue

Congratulations! You are assigned and can now get started on the work.
