## Getting Assigned to an Issue

Claim an issue as yours to work on by commenting on a good first issue with exactly: \assign

We recommend Good First Issues for developers new to the Python SDK. These are easier and better documented tasks.

Key steps:
1. Find an available `Good First Issue` that interests you and is not yet assigned at [Python SDK Good First Issues](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Good%20First%20Issue%22%20no%3Aassignee)
2. Write a comment replying to the issue with: \assign
3. You'll be automatically assigned

Congratulations! You have claimed the issue and can now get started on the work.

Intermediate and advanced issues require team approval to be assigned.
