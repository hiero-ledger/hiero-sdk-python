## Changelog Entry Requirements for the Python SDK
At the Python SDK we require a changelog entry in order to keep helpful records of what was added, changed, fixed or a breaking change for each release.

Key steps:
1. Open 'CHANGELOG.md' found at the project root
2. Add your bullet point entry under [UNRELEASED] and the appropriate subheader (Added, Changed, Fixed or Breaking Change)

Phrase it conventionally.

For example:

##[UNRELEASED]

### Added
- Added `.github/workflows/merge-conflict-bot.yml` to automatically detect and notify users of merge conflicts in Pull Requests.
