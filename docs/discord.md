# Joining the Hiero Community on Discord

Welcome! Our primary space for real-time questions, collaboration, and community chat is the Hiero Discord channel, located within the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT) server.

## What is Discord?

Discord is a popular, free communication platform used by many communities, including open-source projects.
