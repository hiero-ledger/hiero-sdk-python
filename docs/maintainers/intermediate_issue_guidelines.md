# Intermediate Issue Guidelines

## 👋 Welcome, Core Contributors!
You know the basics, you've merged some code, and now you are ready for a challenge. **Intermediate issues** are where you start to own specific parts of the codebase.

## What is an "Intermediate" Issue?
These tasks require you to understand how different parts of the SDK work together.

### What to Expect:
* **Autonomy:** You will be given a problem, and we trust you to design the solution.
* **Complexity:** Tasks might involve refactoring a class, optimizing a function, or adding a new feature that touches multiple files.
* **Code Quality:** We expect clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## 🌟 Expectations

### 1. Explore the Architecture
Take time to understand the module you are working on. How does it interact with the Network Client? How does it handle errors?

### 2. Think About the User
When adding a feature, ask yourself: "Is this easy for another developer to use?" API design matters!

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
Unit tests are mandatory. Integration tests are highly encouraged.
