# Beginner Issue Guidelines — Hiero Python SDK

## How to Use This Document

This guide supports maintainers and issue creators who use the **Beginner** label
in the Hiero Python SDK repository.

It helps:

**Issue creators:**
- Describe approachable, confidence-building tasks  
- Set expectations without over-prescribing solutions  
- Provide helpful context for newer contributors  

**Maintainers:**
- Apply the Beginner label consistently  
- Keep issue difficulty levels clear and welcoming  

This isn’t a rulebook, and it’s not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.  
All contributions — from small fixes to larger improvements — are valuable to the Hiero project.

The **Beginner** label highlights work that supports learning, exploration, and growing confidence.

## Purpose

Beginner Issues represent the **next step after Good First Issues**.

They’re a great fit for contributors who:

- Are comfortable with the basic contribution workflow  
- Want to explore the codebase a little more  
- Are ready to take on slightly more independent work  

These issues help contributors grow their confidence in:

- Reading and understanding existing code  
- Making small, thoughtful changes  
- Asking good questions and learning by doing  

---

## What to Expect

Beginner Issues are designed for contributors who:

- Have basic Python experience  
- Are familiar with Git and the SDK workflow  
- Can navigate a few files in the repository  
- Are open to learning how things work under the hood  

These issues usually involve more exploration than Good First Issues,
but still stay focused, approachable, and well-scoped.

## How Beginner Issues Usually Feel

Beginner Issues often:

- Involve a small number of files  
- Require reading and understanding existing behavior  
- Leave room for small decisions and learning  
- Stay focused on a clear, specific goal  

They’re a great fit for contributors who want to grow their skills without feeling overwhelmed.

## Common Types of Beginner Work

Here are examples of tasks that often fit well at this level:

### Core SDK Changes
- Improving `__str__` or `__repr__` methods  
- Small, localized improvements to utility functions  
- Minor behavior tweaks with clear intent  
- Changes that require understanding how existing code behaves  

### Typing & Code Quality
- Adding missing type hints in simple functions  
- Fixing incorrect type annotations  
- Improving consistency within a file  

### Documentation
- Writing or expanding docs for narrow, well-defined areas  
- Improving clarity in existing documentation  
- Adding helpful explanations to examples  

### Examples
- Creating simple examples based on existing ones  
- Adding missing steps to demonstrate functionality  
- Improving readability or output clarity  
- Making examples more instructional  

### Tests
- Extending existing tests with additional assertions  
- Covering specific edge cases  
- Improving test naming and clarity

## Usually Not Good Fits

- Purely mechanical tasks  
- Large architectural refactors  
- Cross-cutting changes across many subsystems  
- Work requiring deep protocol or DLT expertise  
- Designing new testing frameworks  

These tasks may be a better fit for **Good First Issue**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** labels.

---

## Typical Scope & Time

Beginner Issues are usually:

- ⏱ **Estimated time:** A few hours to a day  
- 📄 **Scope:** One or a few related files  
- 🧠 **Challenge level:** Exploration, learning, and light decision-making  

They’re designed to be achievable in a single pull request.

---

## Support & Collaboration

Beginner Issues are supported through:

- Issue and PR discussions  
- Maintainer and community feedback  
- Friendly guidance and clarification  

Support focuses on:

- Helping contributors understand the code  
- Clarifying expectations  
- Making the learning process enjoyable  

The goal is to build confidence while keeping the experience positive and encouraging.

## Maintainer Guidance

An issue is often a good fit for the **Beginner** label when it:

- Builds naturally on Good First Issues  
- Requires light investigation or interpretation  
- Has a clear goal without being fully scripted  
- Encourages learning and questions  

An issue may be better suited for another label if it:

- Is purely mechanical  
- Requires deep domain expertise  
- Spans many unrelated parts of the codebase  
- Involves architectural or design-level decisions  

---

Beginner Issues are about growing skills —  
through curiosity, exploration, and thoughtful contributions.
