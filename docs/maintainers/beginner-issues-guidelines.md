# Beginner Issue Guidelines

## 👋 Welcome, Rising Stars!

Congratulations on merging your first pull request! You are now ready to take the next step in your open-source journey. **Beginner issues** are designed to help you build confidence and start writing real code.

## What is a "Beginner" Issue?

These tasks are a step up from "Good First Issues." Instead of just fixing typos or config files, you will be touching the **logic** of the SDK.

### What to Expect:

* **Scope:** Small, contained changes (e.g., adding a simple method, fixing a minor bug).
* **Guidance:** The requirements are clear, but you get to decide *how* to implement the solution.
* **Impact:** Your code will be used by real developers!

## 🚀 How to Succeed

### 1. Read the Code First

Before writing new code, look at how similar features are implemented in the SDK. Consistency is key.

### 2. Write Tests

Every new piece of logic needs a test. If you are fixing a bug, write a test that reproduces the bug first.

### 3. Ask for Help

You are not alone! If you get stuck, comment on the issue. We love helping contributors grow.
