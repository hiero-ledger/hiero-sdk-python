# Hiero Contribution Guidelines Overview

Welcome to the Hiero Python SDK! 🚀

We believe that open source is a journey. Whether you are fixing a typo or re-architecting our client, there is a place for you here. To help you find the right task, we classify our issues into difficulty levels.

## 🗺️ Choose Your Adventure

| Level | Ideal For... | What to Expect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Good First Issue Candidate** | **Absolute Beginners** | Found a typo? See a missing docstring? Start here to learn the workflow without pressure. |
| **Good First Issue** | **First-Time Contributors** | Small, isolated tasks (e.g., adding a simple test or config tweak). Great for getting your first PR merged! |
| **Beginner** | **Learners** | You've merged a PR and want to try writing actual code. These tasks involve simple logic changes. |
| **Intermediate** | **Regular Contributors** | You know the codebase. These tasks involve meaningful feature work or refactoring a specific module. |
| **Advanced** | **SDK Architects** | Deep dives into the core. These tasks shape the future of the SDK and require strong technical context. |
