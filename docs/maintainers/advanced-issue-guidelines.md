# Advanced Issue Guidelines

## 👋 Welcome to Advanced Contributions!
Thank you for your interest in tackling Hiero's most challenging and impactful tasks. Advanced issues are the heart of our SDK's evolution, involving core architecture, complex logic, or significant new features.

If you are reading this, you likely have deep experience with the codebase or are looking to make a major impact. We are here to support you in that journey!

## What Makes an Issue "Advanced"?
We classify issues as **Advanced** when they require a comprehensive understanding of the SDK's internal mechanics.

### Typical Characteristics:
* **High Complexity:** Involves multiple interacting components or deep algorithmic logic.
* **Architectural Impact:** Changes that modify the core structure or public API of the SDK.
* **Significant Effort:** Tasks that typically require days, not hours, to design and implement correctly.
* **Risk Factor:** Changes where a bug could have widespread consequences for users.

## 🌟 How to Succeed with Advanced Issues

### 1. Communicate Early and Often
Because these changes are complex, we highly recommend **opening a discussion** before you write a single line of code.
* **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to tag maintainers in the issue comments.
* **Propose a Design:** Briefly outline your plan. It saves you from rewriting code later!

### 2. Focus on Robustness
Advanced features need advanced testing.
* **Edge Cases:** Think about what happens when things go wrong (network partitions, invalid inputs).
* **Performance:** Keep an eye on memory usage and execution time.

### 3. Documentation is Your Best Friend
Since you are likely changing how things work, updating the relevant documentation (docstrings and guides) is essential for the community to understand your brilliant work.

## Examples of Advanced Tasks
* Implementing a new transaction type from scratch.
* Refactoring the network client for better concurrency.
* Overhauling the error handling system.
* Integrating a new cryptographic standard.
