Installation

Installing from PyPI

The latest release of this SDK is published to PyPI. You can install it with:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install hiero_sdk_python

This will pull down a stable release along with the required dependencies.

Installing from Source

You can also clone the repo and install dependencies using uv:

Install uv:

uv is an ultra-fast Python package and project manager. It replaces pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv,
virtualenv, and more.

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

If on macOS, you can also install uv using Homebrew:

brew install uv

Other installation methods can be found here.

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python.git
cd hiero-sdk-python

Install dependencies:

One of the really nice features of uv is that it will download and manage the correct version of python and build
with the correct version of python based on the .python-version  file in the project. This means you don't have to
worry about managing multiple versions of python on your machine!

uv sync
sh generate_proto.sh

To update to a newer version of the protobuf libraries, edit the generate_proto.py file and change the version number
and then rerun it.

Local Editable Installation

For active development, you can install the repo in editable mode. That way, changes in your local code are immediately reflected when you import:

git clone https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python.git
cd hiero-sdk-python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .

Now you can run example scripts like python examples/account_create.py, and it will import from your local hiero_sdk_python code.

Environment Setup

Before using the SDK, you need to configure your environment variables for the operator account and other credentials.
Create a .env file in the root of your project with the following (replace with your environment variables):

OPERATOR_ID=0.0.1234xx
OPERATOR_KEY=af20e47d590300506032b657004220420...
ADMIN_KEY=af20e47d59032b65700321009308ecfdf...
SUPPLY_KEY =302a300506032b6570032100c5e4af5..."
FREEZE_KEY=302a300306072b65700321009308ecfdf...
RECIPIENT_ID=0.0.789xx
TOKEN_ID=0.0.100xx
TOPIC_ID=0.0.200xx
FREEZE_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.100
NETWORK=testnet

A sample .env file is provided in the root of this project. If you do not have an account on
the Hedera testnet, you can easily get one from the Hedera Portal. Learn more about
testnet here.

Running Tests

To run the test suite for the SDK, use the following command:

uv run pytest

The test file in the root of this project will be automatically run when pushing onto a branch.
This is done by running 'Hiero Solo Action'. Read more about it here:

Running Example Scripts

To run the example scripts inside the examples/ directory, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a .env file inside /examples

cd examples
touch .env

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the following content to .env

OPERATOR_ID=0.0.xxxxx
OPERATOR_KEY=302e020100300506032b6570...

You only need these two fields for most examples. Add more if the script requires.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Get your Testnet credentials

Go to https://portal.hedera.com

Sign up or log in

Copy your Account ID and Private Key

Paste into the .env file you just created

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run an example script

cd examples
python3 account_create.py

Make sure dependencies are installed using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you're ready to explore and run all the example scripts! üéâ
