## Verified Commits and Signing Issues

### Problem
Your pull request shows unverified commits, or GitHub rejects your commits because they aren't properly signed.

### Solution
Every commit in this repository **must be both GPG-signed and DCO-signed**. This is a strict requirement for all contributions.

**Required commit command:**
```bash
git commit -S -s -m "your commit message"
```

- `-S` flag: GPG signature (cryptographically proves you authored the commit)
- `-s` flag: DCO sign-off (Developer Certificate of Origin)

**How to set up GPG signing:**

1. Check our comprehensive guide: [Signing Guide](../docs/sdk_developers/signing.md)
2. Generate a GPG key if you don't have one
3. Add your GPG key to your GitHub account
4. Configure Git to use your GPG key

**If you forgot to sign a commit:**
```bash
git commit --amend -S -s
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Common issues:**
- "gpg: signing failed: No secret key" â†’ Your GPG key isn't configured in Git
- Commit shows "Unverified" badge â†’ GPG key not added to GitHub account
- "error: gpg failed to sign the data" â†’ GPG agent may not be running

## Changelog Issues

### Problem
Your PR is blocked because you haven't updated the CHANGELOG.md file, or you're unsure where/how to add your changes.

### Solution
Every contribution **must include an entry in CHANGELOG.md** under the `[Unreleased]` section.

**Location:** `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root

**Format:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Your new feature description

### Fixed
- Your bug fix description

### Changed
- Your improvement description
```

**Requirements:**
- Add one concise sentence describing your change
- Place it in the correct category (Added/Fixed/Changed/Removed)
- Keep it user-focused and descriptive
- Add your entry at the top of the appropriate section

**Example:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Common issues guide for SDK developers at `examples/sdk_developers/common_issues.md`
```

**Why this matters:**
The changelog helps users understand what's new in each release. Your entry will be included in the next version's release notes.
