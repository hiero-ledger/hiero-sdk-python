"""
Example demonstrating contract deletion on the network.

This module shows how to delete a smart contract by:
1. Setting up a client with operator credentials
2. Creating a file containing contract bytecode
3. Creating 2 contracts using the file
4. Deleting the first contract and transferring the hbars to the second contract
5. Checking if the first contract is deleted and the second contract has the hbars
6. Deleting the second contract and transferring the hbars to the operator account
7. Checking if the second contract is deleted

Usage:
    # Due to the way the script is structured, it must be run as a module
    # from the project root directory

    # Run from the project root directory
    python -m examples.contract_delete
