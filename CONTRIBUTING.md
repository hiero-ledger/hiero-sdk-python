## Bug Reports

Please submit bug reports on our [Issues](../../issues) page. When filing a bug:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: See if the bug has already been reported.
2. **Upgrade to the Latest Version**: The bug may have been fixed in a newer release.
3. **Include Detailed Info**: Provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, relevant logs or stack traces, and a minimal working example if possible.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are also submitted via [Issues](../../issues). As with bugs:

1. **Search Existing Requests**: If a request already exists, give it a thumbs-up or comment instead of duplicating.
2. **Detail Your Proposed Solution**: Provide specifics on how you see the feature working or example code to illustrate your idea.

**Tip**: If you plan to implement this feature yourself, mention it so we can assign the issue to you.

## Code Contributions

Code contributions are handled using [Pull Requests](../../pulls). Please ensure:

1. You fork this repository
2. You have an [Issue](../../issues) for any bug or feature youâ€™re working on (to avoid duplicating effort).
3. **All new code has tests** to prove it works as intended or fixes the issue.
4. Follow our [Branching](#branching) and [Committing](#committing) guidelines.

## Branching

We follow a trunk-based development approach. Typical branches:
- `feature/...` for new features
- `fix/...` for bug fixes

The `main` branch should always be stable and production-ready.

## Committing

We use commit types like:
- `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`

Individual commit messages within PRs can be more descriptive and do not necessarily need the prefix, as long as they are clear and meaningful.


## Merging

- We recommend **squash and merge** to keep the commit history tidy.
- Commits should be signed and verified if possible (e.g. `git commit -s -S -m "message"`).
- Pull request titles should begin with types as appropriate (e.g. `feat: add some feature`).  

All Pull Requests must be approved by at least one member of the SDK team before merging.
