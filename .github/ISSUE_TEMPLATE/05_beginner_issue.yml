      description: Who is this issue for?
      value: |
        This issue is intended for contributors who have previously completed a Good First Issue in [Hiero](https://hiero.org) and are at a beginner level.
        We recognize that gaining confidence and building skills are equally important steps in the open-source contributor journey.
        The purpose of this issue—and others listed under [**Find a beginner issue**](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abeginner%20no%3Aassignee)—is to provide a supportive, low-pressure environment where you can learn, practice, and grow your contribution skills with confidence.

        > ### 🐥 Beginner Issue Guidelines
        >
        > Beginner Issues are intended for contributors who are familiar with the project workflow and have **some programming experience** and are wanting opportunities to build skills.
        > These issues may require **light investigation, interpretation of existing code, and some self-initiative**, but should remain **well-scoped with a clear intent**.
        >
        > **What we generally consider beginner issues:**
        >
        > - **Small, well-scoped updates to existing tests**:
        >   - Adjusting or extending an existing test to cover a simple case
        > - **Narrow changes or additions to `src` functionality** using common Python skills, such as:
        >   - Implementing or refining `__str__` methods
        >   - Implementing or refining `__repr__` methods
        >   - Typing improvements, such as return type hints or basic type conflicts
        > - **Documentation improvements** in examples such as creating new examples or docstrings for existing functions
        > - **Functional improvements to existing examples**:
        >   - Adding steps or variations to better demonstrate functionality
        >
        > **What we generally do NOT consider beginner issues:**
        > - Tasks better suited for Good First Issues (purely mechanical or fully guided changes)
        > - Creating entirely new examples or test suites
        > - Changes to core DLT functionality (for example, `to_proto` or `from_proto`)
        > - Work that requires deep knowledge across multiple areas of the codebase

        ## 👾 Description of the issue - Example

        The example for Token Associate Transaction located at examples/tokens/token_associate_transaction.py can be improved. It correctly illustrates how to associate a token, however, it does so all from one function main()

        As everything is grouped together in main(), it is difficult for a user to understand all the individual steps required to associate a token.

        For example:
        ```python

        def run_demo():
            """Monolithic token association demo."""
            print(f"🚀 Connecting to Hedera {network_name} network!")    
            client = Client(Network(network_name))
            operator_id = AccountId.from_string(os.getenv("OPERATOR_ID", ""))
            operator_key = PrivateKey.from_string(os.getenv("OPERATOR_KEY", ""))
            client.set_operator(operator_id, operator_key)
            print(f"✅ Client ready (operator {operator_id})")

            test_key = PrivateKey.generate_ed25519()
            receipt = (
                AccountCreateTransaction()
                .set_key(test_key.public_key())
                .set_initial_balance(Hbar(1))
                .set_account_memo("Test account for token association demo")
                .freeze_with(client)
                .sign(operator_key)
                .execute(client)
            )
            if receipt.status != ResponseCode.SUCCESS:
                raise Exception(receipt.status)
            account_id = receipt.account_id
            print(f"✅ Created test account {account_id}")

            # Create tokens
            tokens = []
            for i in range(3):
                try:
                    receipt = (
                        TokenCreateTransaction()
                        .set_token_name(f"DemoToken{i}")
                        .set_token_symbol(f"DTK{i}")
                        .set_decimals(2)
                        .set_initial_supply(100_000)
                        .set_treasury_account_id(operator_id)
                        .freeze_with(client)
                        .sign(operator_key)
                        .execute(client)
                    )
                    if receipt.status != ResponseCode.SUCCESS:
                        raise Exception(receipt.status)
                    token_id = receipt.token_id
                    tokens.append(token_id)
                    print(f"✅ Created token {token_id}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"❌ Token creation failed: {e}")
                    sys.exit(1)

            # Associate first token
            try:
                TokenAssociateTransaction().set_account_id(account_id).add_token_id(tokens[0]).freeze_with(client).sign(test_key).execute(client)
                print(f"✅ Token {tokens[0]} associated with account {account_id}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"❌ Token association failed: {e}")
                sys.exit(1)

        ## 💡 Solution - Example

        For the TokenAssociateTransaction example, the solution is to split the monolithic main() function for illustrating TokenAssociateTransaction into separate smaller functions which are called from main().
        Such as:
        - Setting up the client
        - Creating an account
        - Creating a token
        - Associating the account to the token

        ### 👩‍💻 Implementation - Example

        To break down the monolithic main function, you need to:
        - [ ] Extract the Key Steps (set up a client, create a test account, create a token, associate the token)
        - [ ] Copy and paste the functionality for each key step into its own function
        - [ ] Pass to each function the variables you need to run it
        - [ ] Call each function in main()
        - [ ] Ensure you return the values you'll need to pass on to the next step in main
        - [ ] Ensure the example still runs and has the same output!

        For example:
        ```python

        def setup_client():
            """Initialize and set up the client with operator account."""

        def create_test_account(client, operator_key):
            """Create a new test account for demonstration."""

        def create_fungible_token(client, operator_id, operator_key):
            """Create a fungible token for association with test account."""

        def associate_token_with_account(client, token_id, account_id, account_key):
            """Associate the token with the test account."""

        def main():
            client, operator_id, operator_key = setup_client()
            account_id, account_private_key = create_test_account(client, operator_key)
            token_id = create_fungible_token(client, operator_id, operator_key)
            associate_token_with_account(client, token_id, account_id, account_private_key)
        ```
