        ## 🌱 Level Up: Beginner Issue

        **You've already proven yourself.** By completing a Good First Issue, you showed you can:
        - ✅ Fork, branch, and open a pull request
        - ✅ Navigate DCO and GPG signing
        - ✅ Work with the Hiero team

        This beginner issue is your **next step** — a chance to build confidence through slightly more independent work.
        You're not starting over; you're leveling up. 📈

      description: Context for beginner contributors
      value: |
        This issue is intended for contributors who have previously completed a Good First Issue in
        [Hiero](https://hiero.org) and are ready to take on slightly more independent work.

        **Expected time:** A few hours to a day
        **Scope:** One or a few related files
        **Challenge:** Exploration, learning, light decision-making

        Unlike Good First Issues (which are fully guided), Beginner Issues encourage you to:
        - Read and understand existing code patterns
        - Make small, thoughtful implementation choices
        - Ask questions when stuck (that's a skill, not a weakness!)

        You're building the confidence to tackle Intermediate issues next.

        > **Good fits for Beginner Issues:**
        > - Small, well-scoped updates to existing tests
        > - Implementing or refining `__str__` or `__repr__` methods
        > - Adding type hints or fixing type issues
        > - Creating or improving docstrings for existing functions
        > - Enhancing existing examples with better demonstrations
        >
        > **Not Beginner Issues:**
        > - Purely mechanical tasks (those are Good First Issues)
        > - Creating entirely new examples or test suites
        > - Core DLT logic (`to_proto`, `from_proto`)
        > - Work spanning many unrelated areas of the codebase
        >

        ### 👾 Example Issue Description

        The `AccountId` class at `src/hiero_sdk_python/account/account_id.py` implements a
        `__repr__()` method that currently falls back to the default object representation:

        ```python
        <hiero.account_id.AccountId object at 0x7f9c2a3b8d60>
        ```

        This isn't helpful when debugging. We want it to show the actual account details
        so developers can quickly identify values during debugging sessions.

        ### 💡 Example Solution

        After your change, `repr(account_id)` should return a clear, informative string:
        ```python
        AccountId(shard=0, realm=0, num=1234)
        ```

        This follows the pattern used by other ID classes in the SDK.

      value: |
        **Start by exploring:**
        - [ ] Find the relevant file in `src/`
        - [ ] Look at how similar classes handle this (check for patterns)
        - [ ] Review the `__init__()` method to understand the class fields

        **Then implement:**
        - [ ] [Add specific implementation steps here]

        **Verify your work:**
        - [ ] Run relevant tests: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_[relevant].py`
        - [ ] Test manually in a Python REPL if helpful

        > ### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
        >
        > Based on past beginner PRs, watch out for:
        >
        > 1. **Changing more than needed** — Only modify files mentioned in this issue
        > 2. **Forgetting to test** — Always run `uv run pytest` before pushing
        > 3. **Copying AI output blindly** — Verify methods actually exist in the codebase
        > 4. **Skipping the changelog** — Your PR cannot merge without it
        > 5. **Breaking existing behavior** — Check that existing tests still pass
        > 6. **Changing return types unexpectedly** — This can break other code that depends on them

        You are welcome to use AI to help you understand and solve this issue.

        **Good uses:**
        - Explaining what existing code does
        - Suggesting approaches to investigate
        - Understanding error messages

        **Risky uses (be careful!):**
        - Generating code without verifying it compiles and works
        - Using methods that don't exist in this codebase
        - Changing parameters or return types without understanding the impact

        When in doubt, check the source code directly or ask a maintainer.
