        > ### 📋 Good First Issue (GFI) Guidelines
        > A Good First Issue is intended to be a small, well-scoped task for new contributors to get started with the codebase and contribution workflow.
        >        
        > **Often a good fit for Good First Issues:**
        > - Spelling or grammar fixes
        > - Small documentation formatting improvements
        > - Purely structural refactors of examples
        > - Minor, clearly described edits to docstrings or comments
        > - Light file moves or renames for clarity
        > - Applying formatting tools (e.g. `black`, `ruff`) in limited areas
        >
        > More involved tasks may be a better fit for **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**—this is guidance, not a hard rule.
        >
        > If you’re unsure, the **Good First Issue Candidate Template** can help.

        ## 👾 Description of the issue - Example

        The example for Token Associate Transaction located at examples/tokens/token_associate_transaction.py can be improved. It correctly illustrates how to associate a token, however, it does so all from one function main()

        As everything is grouped together in main(), it is difficult for a user to understand all the individual steps required to associate a token.

        For example:
        ```python

        def run_demo():
            """Monolithic token association demo."""
            print(f"🚀 Connecting to Hedera {network_name} network!")    
            client = Client(Network(network_name))
            operator_id = AccountId.from_string(os.getenv("OPERATOR_ID", ""))
            operator_key = PrivateKey.from_string(os.getenv("OPERATOR_KEY", ""))
            client.set_operator(operator_id, operator_key)
            print(f"✅ Client ready (operator {operator_id})")

            test_key = PrivateKey.generate_ed25519()
            receipt = (
                AccountCreateTransaction()
                .set_key(test_key.public_key())
                .set_initial_balance(Hbar(1))
                .set_account_memo("Test account for token association demo")
                .freeze_with(client)
                .sign(operator_key)
                .execute(client)
            )
            if receipt.status != ResponseCode.SUCCESS:
                raise Exception(receipt.status)
            account_id = receipt.account_id
            print(f"✅ Created test account {account_id}")

            # Create tokens
            tokens = []
            for i in range(3):
                try:
                    receipt = (
                        TokenCreateTransaction()
                        .set_token_name(f"DemoToken{i}")
                        .set_token_symbol(f"DTK{i}")
                        .set_decimals(2)
                        .set_initial_supply(100_000)
                        .set_treasury_account_id(operator_id)
                        .freeze_with(client)
                        .sign(operator_key)
                        .execute(client)
                    )
                    if receipt.status != ResponseCode.SUCCESS:
                        raise Exception(receipt.status)
                    token_id = receipt.token_id
                    tokens.append(token_id)
                    print(f"✅ Created token {token_id}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"❌ Token creation failed: {e}")
                    sys.exit(1)

            # Associate first token
            try:
                TokenAssociateTransaction().set_account_id(account_id).add_token_id(tokens[0]).freeze_with(client).sign(test_key).execute(client)
                print(f"✅ Token {tokens[0]} associated with account {account_id}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"❌ Token association failed: {e}")

        ## 💡 Solution - Example

        For the TokenAssociateTransaction example, the solution is to split the monolithic main() function for illustrating TokenAssociateTransaction into separate smaller functions which are called from main().
        Such as:
        - Setting up the client
        - Creating an account
        - Creating a token
        - Associating the account to the token

        ### 👩‍💻 Implementation - Example

        To break down the monolithic main function, you need to:
        - [ ] Extract the Key Steps (set up a client, create a test account, create a token, associate the token)
        - [ ] Copy and paste the functionality for each key step into its own function
        - [ ] Pass to each function the variables you need to run it
        - [ ] Call each function in main()
        - [ ] Ensure you return the values you'll need to pass on to the next step in main
        - [ ] Ensure the example still runs and has the same output!

        For example:
        ```python

        def setup_client():
            """Initialize and set up the client with operator account."""

        def create_test_account(client, operator_key):
            """Create a new test account for demonstration."""

        def create_fungible_token(client, operator_id, operator_key):
            """Create a fungible token for association with test account."""

        def associate_token_with_account(client, token_id, account_id, account_key):
            """Associate the token with the test account."""

        def main():
            client, operator_id, operator_key = setup_client()
            account_id, account_private_key = create_test_account(client, operator_key)
            token_id = create_fungible_token(client, operator_id, operator_key)
            associate_token_with_account(client, token_id, account_id, account_private_key)
        ```

      value: |
        Congratulations on creating a PR! 

        Your PR will now be tested by several workflows, including:
        - [ ] Commit signing: are commits DCO and GPG signed?
        - [ ] Changely entry: do you have an entry under the unreleased version?
        - [ ] Examples: do all the examples still run as expected?
        - [ ] Unit and Integration tests: is all the existing functionality working fine?
        - [ ] Codacy: is the code quality using safe methods?

        Your PR will also get helpful, near-instant feedback from our prompted CodeRabbit AI
        - It will:
        - Check the issue description is satisfied
        - Provide actionable code suggestions

        - Note that:
        - AI's can make mistakes or make exagerrations
        - Not all of its suggestions are relevant to the issue.
        -        
        - Your PR will shortly be reviewed by a Python SDK team member
        - We are a little slower than the AI but will typically by able to review your PR within 1-3 days.
        - We might approve your PR or request changes. Be sure to make any needed changes or corrections 
        - 
        - Once approved, your PR will be merged typically within a day.
        -
        - Note:
        - Since the Python SDK updates regularly, with PRs from other contributors frequently merged, you can face merge-conflicts.
        - If it is a merge conflict with your changelog, use the online editor in the pull request to accept both changes
        - If it is a merge conflict with other files, you'll need to rebase and manually resolve [Guide](TBC).
        - In this case, this will trigger another review (https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/blob/main/docs/sdk_developers/changelog_entry.md
